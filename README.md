### Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing operational personnel management for Israeli Air Force (IAF) squadrons. 
By analyzing historical operational data and scheduling constraints, we developed a data-driven model to improve readiness, reduce workload bottlenecks, and optimize shift scheduling during routine and emergency scenarios.

**Grade:** 92 (Final Project, B.Sc. Industrial Engineering & Management)

### Key Features & Methodology
* **Operations Research:** Defined the optimization problem (minimizing workload imbalance, maximizing readiness) subject to IAF operational constraints.
* **Data Analysis (EDA):** Processed and cleaned raw operational logs to identify root causes of scheduling errors and non-compliant assignments.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Conducted correlation analysis between workload metrics and error rates. 
* **KPI Definition:** Defined and measured key performance indicators such as *Rest Compliance*, *Readiness Level*, and *Shift Imbalance*.

### Tools & Technologies
* **Programming:** Python (used in the `/code` folder)
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib 
* **Methodologies:** Operations Research, Statistical Analysis, Process Improvement.

### Repository Structure
* **`code/`**: Contains the Python notebook (`quantitative_data_analysis.ipynb`) for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
* **`data/`**: Contains the anonymized operational data file (`operational_metrics_data.xlsx`), which includes multiple sheets for different data resolutions (e.g., Weekly Data, Monthly Data).
* **`docs/`**: Contains the full academic report (`Project_Final_Report.pdf`), detailing the methodology, operational research, and final recommendations.

*Note: All data and names have been anonymized to comply with information security regulations.*
